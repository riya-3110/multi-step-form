# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Multi-Step Form with Validation
Goal: Build a multi-step form for collecting user information, such as:

Name, Email
Address, Phone Number
Review & Submit
Validate inputs at each step.
Show a progress bar.
Store data in local state & submit it to an API.
Concepts: useState, react-hook-form, validation, conditional rendering.

Bonus: Save form progress using localStorage.
